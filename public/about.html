<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m a beginner web developer who loves experimenting with code and design to bring simple ideas to life online. 
  <br/>I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build clean and easy-to-use websites.</p>

<p>Most of my projects are small and personal, but they’ve given me the chance to explore how websites work and how to make them responsive and interactive. 
  <br/>Each one has been a fun step in improving my skills.</p>

<p>I’m excited to keep learning, trying new things, and sharing my progress here. Web development is still new to me, 
<br/>  but I love the process of creating something from scratch and seeing it come to life on the screen.</p>
